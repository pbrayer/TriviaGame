# TriviaGame

What the project does:
User clicks "start game" and then proceeds through 8 GoT themed questions before viewing the result page with correct / incorrect answer count.

It's a great source of entertainment!

Users will need to click start button, and they also may want to research GoT a bit beforehand by reading the books / watching the show.
